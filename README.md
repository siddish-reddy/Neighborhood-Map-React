### Running Locally
This project has external dependencies on Google Maps API, FourSquare APIs, react-burger-menu.<br/>
You need to get those APIs from the providers and place them in Map.js and FourSquare.js files(I may have probably reset them by now or quota may have exceeded).
Then run `npm install` for installing dependencies and finally
#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
