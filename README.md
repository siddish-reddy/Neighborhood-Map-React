### Running Locally
This project has external dependencies on Google Maps API, FourSquare APIs, react-burger-menu.<br/>
You need to get those APIs from the providers and place them in Map.js and FourSquare.js files(I may have probably reset them by now or quota may have exceeded).
Then run `npm install` for installing dependencies and finally
#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. <br/>
Service Worker is not available in development mode
To run in production mode use `npm build` cd into build folder and start server using npm's serve or python static http server.
Service worker will be enabled in production mode.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
